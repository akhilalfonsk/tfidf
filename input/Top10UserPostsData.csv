18139375,49153,<p>I have the following directive:</p><pre><code>MyApp.directive('myFilter', ['$filter','$rootScope',function($filter, $rootScope){    var dir = {};    dir.restrict = 'E';    dir.templateUrl = 'views/myFilter.html';    dir.replace = true;    dir.scope =         {            name: '@',            model: '=',        };    dir.link = function(scope,el,attrs)    {                //stuff here    }    return dir; }]);</code></pre><p>Here's how I invoke it:</p><pre><code>&lt;my-filter model="someField" name="abcd" /&gt;</code></pre><p>When the directive is first initalized, the <code>someField</code> is empty. Later on, it is retrieved via ajax, and its value is filled in.</p><p>Question is, how can I watch for the value of <code>someField</code> to be updated? When I do this from the link method:</p><pre><code>scope.$watch(scope.model, function(){   console.log( "changed, new val: ", scope.model );}</code></pre><p>This is only called once, when initalizing the directive, and the value then is empty. When the value is retrieved via ajax (from <code>$http.get</code>), this watch function is not called again. However, in other parts of the page where I'm displaying <code>{{someField}}</code>, that value DOES update when ajax request is fetched. So I don't think the problem has to do with doing <code>$scope.apply()</code> after ajax request.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> <code>someField</code> is assigned in the controller. Here is the code:</p><pre><code>MyApp.controller('myCtrl', ['$scope', '$rootScope', '$routeParams', 'ajax', '$filter',function($scope, $rootScope, $routeParams, ajax, $filter){    var userId = parseInt( $routeParams.userId );            $scope.loaded = false;    $scope.someField = ""; //initalize with empty value    var load = function(data)    {        $scope.loaded = true;        $scope.someField = data.someField;                };            ajax.getUser(userId).success(load);               }]);</code></pre><p>The method <code>ajax.getUser()</code> does a <code>$http.get()</code> and returns its <code>promise</code>. In the code above, the <code>load</code> method is called which sets the value of <code>someField</code>.</p>

This can be very useful for site-wide navigation, especially on template-driven sites where the whole of the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element could come from a template file.</p>    <p>Of course, it's not required that the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> be in the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>.</p>    <p>If depends largely on whether you believe the site-wide navigation belongs in the site-wide header and also pragmatic considerations about ease of styling.</p></blockquote><p>Based on that last sentence, it appears that Bruce Lawson—author of the chapter those excerpts are from—admits that "pragmatic considerations about ease of styling" yield a coupling between the content and the style.</p>
